# The Assignment Problem as a Linear Program

This repository contains a few versions of auction algorithms. While both use Python, one is simply iterative and the 
other utilizes [Google's Optimization Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/) in a linear programming approach. Both
versions implement a naive auction algorithm (as opposed to a terminated auction algorithm involving the use of some epsilon value to ensure 
object prices increase every round). More information on this algorithm can be found [here](http://www.masfoundations.org/mas.pdf).
